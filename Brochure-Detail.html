   <p class="brochure-description">Circle Craft is an annual Christmas craft fair in Vancouver, BC that showcases unique artists, craftsmanship and interesting locally made products. As part of a publishing course I took at Simon Fraser University (SFU) we recieved a task to create a brochure for an event of our choice. I chose Circle Craft as it was an upcoming event that I was interested in learning more about. I also felt this would be a great opportunity to learn more about branding based on the market's identity</p>

 <!-- Process - Research -->

 <div class="heading-container">
  <h1 class="title-headings">Process</h1>
  <h2 class="img-title">Research</h2>
</div>

<div class="grid-col-5of10">
  
 <p class="brochure-intro">I began my design process by researching and learning about the people behind Circle Craft and their story. I noted their branding elements as I discovered their articles, website, event schedule booklet and their social media outlets. I checked their archival material and even researched prominent crafters/artists to gather more insight into the event. The image shows initial research and reference gathering. </p>

<!-- Process - Sketching -->

<div class="heading-container">
  <h1 class="title-headings">Process</h1>
  <h2 class="img-title">Sketching</h2>
</div>

<div class="grid-col-5of10">
 <p class="brochure-intro">Intial sketches were based on small ideas based on the research and reference images I had gathered. Sketching allowed me to get a sense of mixing content with images and creative ways that I could build to showcase the event but also follow the brand. For example, I thought of whether a shaped pattern of images would be interesting to explore.</p>

<!-- Process - Wireframes -->

<div class="heading-container">
  <h1 class="title-headings">Process</h1>
  <h2 class="img-title">Wireframe</h2>
</div>

<div class="grid-col-5of10">
  
 <p class="brochure-intro">I built several different wireframes and mockups throughout my process, but would end up using one quite similar to the one shown to the right. Based on many iterations of sketches and the research, I wanted to make sure to display many images of the previous years and to describe key highlights. The wireframing helped me understand layout schemes and I became more familiar with tri-fold brochure settings and new tools within InDesign.</p>

<!-- Final Print --> 
<div class="heading-container">
  <h1 class="title-headings">Final</h1>
  
</div>

<div class="grid-col-5of10">
  
 <p class="brochure-intro">The final design was influenced greatly by logo's, colours, typography and imagery of Circle Craft's branding outlines. By showcasing those elements, it creates a much more effect symbolic promtional item. I also wanted to fit in the Christmas theme by using decorative elements such as ornaments for images. I ensured to provide content that was most relevant and featured prominent events shown at the market *Note: Any image/logo borrowed from Circle Craft was cited.</p>
 
 <div class="heading-container">
  <h1 class="title-headings">Outcome</h1>
</div>
<p class="brochure-intro">I recieved praise from my professor and others for demonstrating effective branding and overall use of colour and layout elements. I also learned through feedback of areas I could improve such as showcasing more photos of the artisans in replacement of the Christmas tree which may confuse viewers. It was great to recieve feedback as it allowed me to improve my critical thinking and strategies for enhancing communication of products on future projects.</p>
