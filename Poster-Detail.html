     <p class="gotham-description">Creating a typeface poster was a unique project that began through a publishing course and it allowed me to explore a font's history, it's inspirations and application within the real world. Gotham was designed from inspiration of various classic (1920's-60's) New York Street Signage on businesses, boutiques and even subway/bus stations. It is a typeface that reflects back to an era of New York city in which bold and bare meant a prominent, industrious and business driven society.

    </div>

    <div class="grid-col-5of10">

     <p class="gotham-intro">I began my design process by gathering background information on the typeface history  while also collecting sample images based on that research. I learned that Gotham was heavily influenced by New York City, was used in President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign and appears in many advertisments.</p>

  <div class="grid-col-5of10">

   <p class="gotham-intro">I used the research and images as inspiration and references while sketching and ideating different types of layouts I could showcase for Gotham. These are my first inital sketches that illustrate a few different layout schemes and element patterns. It also displays that through the research gathered I was generating ways in which I could link the importance of New York within the poster. </p>

    <h2 class="img-title">Wireframe</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-col-5of10">

   <p class="gotham-intro">I took the most developed sketches into InDesign and began 
    creating the basic layouts for each element. I focused on one main layout, that
    would showcase a prominent letter in the top left, and a simple description or typeface styles
    beside it. The middle area would have more styling or showcase of alphabetical letters. The bottom would
    be an image representative of New York city, to emphasize it's orgins</p>

  <!-- Final Print --> 
  <div class="heading-container">
    <h1 class="title-headings">Final</h1>

  </div>

  <div class="grid-col-5of10">

   <p class="gotham-intro">The final design was a result of various research and sketching ideas and revisions 
    of different wireframe layouts. The prominent letter G is to grab the eye while also hinting at the topic.
    A brief description describes a bit of it's history and application and the typeface styling is evidenced within the middle. I ended up with a silhouette skyline of New York city as a way to show the fonts connection and influence. Note* The image was retrieved from an online source and citated accordingly<p>


    <div class="heading-container">
      <h1 class="title-headings">Outcome</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="gotham-intro">I recieved praise from instructors and peers for understanding Gotham's history and then connecting that using the silhouette of New York. My instructors liked the simplicity of the silhouette in showcasing the typeface, but would have also liked me to expand that further and make it more iconic. I agree with their feedback as in many of my original ideation sketches I had explored more dynamic and bold styles.</p>
